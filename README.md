# Quantitative Asset Allocation and Liability Modelling Using Mean-Variance Optimization

ACST3007 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 1 (2023)

This assignment applied mean-variance optimization to model asset and liability portfolios for quantitative risk management. Focused on variance analysis, efficient allocation, and actuarial implications.

## Key Tasks
- Constructed mean-variance efficient frontier for assets and liabilities  
- Analyzed portfolio variance and covariance  
- Optimized allocation for risk-return balance  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Mean-variance optimization and portfolio theory  
- Quantitative variance and covariance modelling  
- Actuarial asset-liability management  

## Submission Details
- The attached PDF is the rendered output from an original R Markdown (.Rmd) document.  
  (Original .Rmd source file is no longer available, but the PDF preserves all optimization results, variance analysis, and quantitative conclusions.)
- Excel file contains supporting data and calculations used in the model.
